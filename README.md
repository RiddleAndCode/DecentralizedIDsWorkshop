# #DecentralizeVienna

Welcome to the Decentralized IDs Workshop! We're excited to have you here. We will use this repository to post code, information and collaborative work that we will accomplish over the next couple of days. Feel free to submit pull requests, clone and browse. Use the [Issues](https://github.com/RiddleAndCode/DecentralizedIdentityWorkshop/issues) to mark down ideas and pose questions.

Email [julian@riddleandcode.com](mailto:julian@riddleandcode.com) if you have any questions or concerns!
