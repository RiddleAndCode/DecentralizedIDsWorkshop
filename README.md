# #DecentralizeVienna

Welcome to the Decentralized IDs Workshop! We're excited to have you here. We will use this repository to post code, information and collaborative work that we will accomplish over the next couple of days. Feel free to submit pull requests, clone and browse. Use the [Issues](https://github.com/RiddleAndCode/DecentralizedIdentityWorkshop/issues) to mark down ideas and pose questions.

Email [julian@riddleandcode.com](mailto:julian@riddleandcode.com) if you have any questions or concerns!

The following focus groups were active during the workshop:

* [Introduction to DID, IPDB method definition & IPDB DID resolver integration](https://github.com/RiddleAndCode/DecentralizedIDsWorkshop/tree/master/did)
* [DID & TLS: Authentication and secure communication between parties based on TLS in combination with DIDs](https://github.com/RiddleAndCode/DecentralizedIDsWorkshop/blob/master/tls/resources.md)
* [Exploring Cryptographic Group Access Control and Authentification with SGX](https://github.com/RiddleAndCode/DecentralizedIDsWorkshop/tree/master/CryptoAccessControl)
* [Machine Identities & DIDs: Connecting Machine Identities, IPDB and zenroom based smart contracting with the help of DIDs](https://github.com/RiddleAndCode/DecentralizedIDsWorkshop/tree/master/MachineIDs_DIDs)

Please follow the links to add documentation or to read the current state of the projects. We are looking forward to further collaboration on these topics that go beyond the scope of the workshop.
