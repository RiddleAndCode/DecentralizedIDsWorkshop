# Machine Identities & DIDs

The goal of the workshop was to connect most recently developed IPDB primitives and connect them via DIDs.

The used primitives are listed below:
* IPDB
* Zenroom & Zencode
* RIDDLE&CODE SecureElement
* Raspberry PIs for rapid prototyping
* IPDB based DID methods 
* newly created IPDB tansactions schemes
